# MDS_Anomaly_Detection_In_Satellite_Data_1881197

This repository is for my Data Science Research Project for my masters degree in Data Science at The University of Adelaide.

The python coding provided in this repository provides Exploratory Data Analysis for 5 satellites and it also provides forecasting using ARIMA for each element in the time series data.

The jupyter notebooks are named in a manner where EDA files and forecasting files can be easily recognized. The file format shows whether it is EDA or Forecasting, the satellite which is being analysed, the elements which are being forecasted, etc.

# How to run the Jupyter Notebooks
To run the files, update the file paths in the code to the relevant files in your local environment. And if any libraries are not available in your local environment those should be installed accordingly.
